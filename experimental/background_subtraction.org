* Background Subtraction

  OpenCV has several different background subtraction algorithms. They all have
  the same API, which makes trying them out pretty straightforward.

  #+begin_src python
#!/usr/bin/env python2

import numpy as np
import cv2
import sys

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(sys.argv[1])

fgbg = cv2.BackgroundSubtractorMOG()

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    fgmask = fgbg.apply(frame)

    cv2.imshow('frame', fgmask)

    key = cv2.waitKey(30) & 0xff
    if key == 27:
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
  #+end_src

  [[file:figs/mog_bgsub.png][BackgroundSubtractorMOG]] seems to work a bit better than [[file:figs/mog2_bgsub.png][MOG2]] (on
  non-Hearthstone but still online-TCG data). MOG2 has growing regions which I
  think are shadows? MOG doesn't have these.
